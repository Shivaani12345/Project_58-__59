        <p>Starlight was first introduced in the Season 5 episode The Cutie Map, where she was the main antagonist. She later reformed in the Season 5 finale The Cutie Re-Mark.

            In the half-hour Equestria Girls special Mirror Magic, when Sunset Shimmer returns to Equestria, Starlight appears and gives her a new magic journal and becomes very interested in the world on the other side of the Crystal Mirror. She convinces Sunset to take her along, and she transforms into a human upon arriving.

            When Sunset and her friends become trapped in limbo through Juniper Montage's enchanted mirror, and Juniper starts terrorizing mall patrons, Starlight convinces her to stop by offering to be her friend, causing Juniper to put things back. The girls forgive Juniper, especially Starlight, Twilight, and Sunset who sympathize with her since they had corrupted magic experiences. In the end, Starlight helps Sunset to not worry so much about future dangers and to live in the moment, and through a message from Twilight in Sunset's journal, she is allowed to stay in the human world for a few more days. </p>

        <h1>Her life</h1>
        <p>Starlight glimmer is one of the most powerful ponies in Equestria. She lives in Princess Twilight ( Princess of Friendship) Castle near Ponyville. But she grew up in a small village where ponies where all the same and not unique and she was like a Mayor. Actually she wasn’t a pony that didn’t have any uniqueness like all the other ponies in the village also had specialties but she used her magic to remove that and said to the ponies that they can be stronger without magic. She did so because she grew up all alone without friends. When she was very young she lived in a small town known as Siers Hollow there she had a friend named Sunburst but after some time she found his special talent and went to study in Princess Celestia’s school of magic and she was left alone.</p>
